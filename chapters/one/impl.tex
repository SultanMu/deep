\section{Implementation}
With the full algorithm of the back propagation a full Neural Network could be developed. You can do it by following the steps and code it in \textit{Python}, \textit{Haskell}, \textit{Matlab} \dots But as you develop your net you will notice that it is only valid for a certain network architecture, and it is pretty slow because of the languages. You can develop it on \textit{C++} or even in \textit{C} what will need a lot of effort for achieving more speed.

But as Neural Networks are not new and as they are well known and famous, there are many tools you can choose for creating your model. It will be much faster to implement it and the net will run also faster since the tools are optimized. One of the most famous tools is developed by \textit{Google}. They are the kings of de big data and they are using the data for machine learning so they have created \textit{TensorFlow} carefully to fullfill all their needs.
