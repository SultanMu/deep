\chapter{Neural Networks}
The brain has been studied deeply during the last century. The researchers wanted to use the power of the brain in a mathematical or computational model. The first step in the Deep Learning was to copy the behaviour of the brain neurons to a circuit (1943, neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts). The poor computing capacity of the time stopped the studies on the topic.\\

In the 80s the field became again interesting with the inclusion of multiple layered neural networks. In 1986 researchers modeled the idea of back propagation. This idea helps the network to distribute pattern recognition errors throughout the whole network. The problem is that with this algorithm the net learn slowly, so many iterations are needed. \\

Nowadays Neural Networks are incredibly important. The big data and the computing capacity are a perfect base for the networks. Also with new types of models such as Convolutional Neural Networks or Recurrent Neural Networks they are solving amazing problems beyond the image recognition. \cite{hnet1} \cite{hnet2}
