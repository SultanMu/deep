\section{What is a Neural Network}
You could think of a Neural Network as a box with a certain number of inputs and outputs. For a given input the box answer with a output, that is the network prediction.

Let us imagine that we have one box of this kind, and if you input a image of a handwritten digit, the output of the box will be the digit of the picture. You could think that if you create one box like this you have all your work done, but the box by itself is stupid. If you create a box and feed it with the picture of a '1' the output could be whatever.

What we should do is to teach the net so it could answer correctly. To achieve it our box has several knobs that we can regulate in order to tell the box how bad was the prediction it said. In that way, after correcting the knobs several times, the box has learned, what means that it is ready for answer right. Now we have a box with the knowledge to make good predictions, but since it is a box we cannot outcome any knowledge for us. We cannot get any method to create an algorythm that solve our task more efficiently. We just can use our box, and get our answer from our box.
