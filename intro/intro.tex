From the begining of computing, the machines have solve probems incredibly difficult for a human, problems based on mathematicals rules. But what has been a really difficult task for computer was to solve some problems that are simple and easy for humans such as images or speech recognition. Tasks that a person perform easily but that are difficult to describe formally.

A person needs a big amount of knowledge to live and to understand, and many times this knowledge cannot be described in a formal way. That means that if we want the computers to performs the same tasks as an human, that computer should acquire that knowledge, by learning.\\

If it is said that a computer learns that means that it understands a complex concept as a hierachy of simpler concepts. The hierachy of concepts is deep, with many layers composed of concepts, and hence the term of deep learning.\\

To achieve this approach Neural Networks are going to be used. They are copying the behaviour of a brain neural network. Multiple layers of neurons that are connected to each others and pass information through those connections. This model, allows the computer to learn since the neurons adapt the output for a given input depending on the expected answer. That means that with a big amount of data to learn, the network could predict a correct answer for the input. \cite{deepbook}
